Carol	Written note	"Dolly,
I heard from Tom in Division B that testing is not going as planned. I'm going to have to start looking for another job. Phil and I can't wait around for the next round of budget cuts.
I wish you luck, but I've got to get out of here.
Carol"
F	Written note	"P,
Here are those accounting documents you wanted. Shred them when you're done. 
Take a look at the debt to equity numbers. If I were you, I'd sell.

Shawn	Written note	"Paul,
Have you seen Carpathian Tech's latest demo? Holographic food and cell phones! They are way ahead of us. I don't know if the company will be around much longer if they don't catch up.

Cindy	Written note	"Dina,
I'm scared. The latest rounds of Holofield testing didn't meet expectations. Management is wanting completed numbers soon. I don't want to say it failed again, I need this job. 
Should I fudge the numbers? No, thats wrong... But I can't fail them either. 
I don't know what to do...
Cindy"
Derek	Written note	"Cindy, 
It was quite apparent the Holofield did not pass safety expectations, yet you signed the paperwork to let it through. 
I have no choice but to report this to Management. 
I would suggest you start packing your desk. 
Derek "
Sarah	Written note	"Audra,
You sly fox! I know you brought your baby here to show him off, he is such a cute little thing! 
I also saw that gave you extra access to other departments for show-and-tell.
Don't think I didn't see you slip a couple folders into your stroller. I'll have my eye on you ;) 
Sarah"
Derek	Written note	Aaron - get out. Get out now. Management knows what you did and they are on their way. 
Clara/Thomas	IM thread	"Clara: That was a difficult meeting... Half of the analytics team was just let go. 
Thomas: I heard it was because they disagreed with how management was running the company. 
Clara: srsly!? 
Thomas: Yea, you didn't hear it from me, but Derek was talking to Cindy safety tests that were passed, but actually failed. HR showed up within 20 minutes to his desk and he was gone. 
Clara: ... working here is getting scary.
Thomas: no - no.. its not. We just have to do our jobs and not ask questions. 
Thomas: ... we better just leave it at that. "
Theo/Alice	IM thread	"Alice: T-man! Did you sign the birthday card I left on your desk?
Theo: No... why would I do that? 
Alice: 1) its nice. 2) he's the CEO's son. You have to. 
Theo: I don't have to do anything. 
Alice: You may not like it, but he has a lot of pull around here, plus - they take attendance based on who signs the cards. 
Theo: I don't want to and you can't make me. I come in and do my job, that should be good enough. 
Alice: Fine. I'll forge your name like last time. "
