  content: "Audra,\r\n\nYou sly fox! I know you brought your baby here to show him
    off, he is such a cute little thing! \r\nI also saw that gave you extra access
    to other departments for show-and-tell.\r\nDon't think I didn't see you slip
    a couple folders into your stroller. I'll have my eye on you ;) \r\n\nSarah"
