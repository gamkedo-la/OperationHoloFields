  content: "Patient 97 is exhibiting signs of delusion. They are reaching for items
    that do not exist even after the reality filter has been re-activated.\r\nHypothesis:
    Patients with the capability to see both realms next fully leave either realm.
    \r\n\r\nPatient 110 is exhibiting severe signs of distress. They are screaming
    and shaking violently in the corner of the room saying - \"Make it stop\". Unresponsive
    to interuption.\r\nHypothesis: Patient was stretched too far in the second realm
    and have been unable to re-attach themselves to reality. \r\n\r\nPatient 115
    and 116 appear to be colluding and working together. This is tremendous progress.
    They appear to be harnessing the powers to complete the given puzzles. \r\nUnfortunately:
    During one drop, their reality was incorrect and they plummeted into the pit.
    We should really look into removing such dangerous items from the test chambers. "
